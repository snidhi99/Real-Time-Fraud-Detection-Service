# Real-Time-Fraud-Detection-Service

## Overview 📝:
This repo hosts a real-time fraud detection service, enabling the swift identification of fraudulent transactions. Utilizing interactive machine learning (ML) feature development, the service enables the detection of fraudulent activities in real-time, as well as offers the transition of ML features into production for reliable, scalable, and low-latency deployment. 

### Utilizing Tecton as the Production Environment
In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to leverage Tecton as the production environment for building and deploying real-time ML models. Tecton simplifies the process of defining, testing, and deploying features for training and serving, allowing for rapid development and deployment of production-grade ML systems.

We will showcase the following steps using Tecton:

1. **Connect to Data on S3:** We'll connect to data stored on Amazon S3, a popular cloud storage service, to access the necessary data for building our fraud detection model.

2. **Define and Test Features:** Using Tecton, we'll define and test features crucial for training our fraud detection model. Tecton provides a user-friendly interface for feature engineering and experimentation.

3. **Generate a Training Dataset and Train a Model:** Tecton streamlines the process of generating training datasets by efficiently combining and transforming features. We'll use Tecton to create a training dataset and train a fraud detection model.

4. **Productionize Features for Real-Time Serving:** Tecton excels at productionizing features, making them readily available for real-time serving. We'll demonstrate how to deploy our engineered features using Tecton's serving infrastructure.

5. **Run Real-Time Inference:** Finally, we'll showcase how to leverage Tecton's serving capabilities to run real-time inference, allowing us to predict fraudulent transactions in a production environment.
