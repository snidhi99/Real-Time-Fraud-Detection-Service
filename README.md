# Real-Time-Fraud-Detection-Service
This repo hosts a real-time fraud detection service, enabling the swift identification of fraudulent transactions. Utilizing interactive machine learning (ML) feature development, the service enables the detection of fraudulent activities in real-time, as well as offers the transition of ML features into production for reliable, scalable, and low-latency deployment. 

## Features considered:

### Interactive ML Feature Development:
- Develop and test ML features interactively using batch, streaming, and real-time data signals within a Python-based notebook environment.

### Easy Productionization of ML Features:
- Easily transition ML features into production, ensuring they are served reliably in real time, scalable, and with low latency.

### Real-Time Inference:
- Leverage ML features to run real-time inference and predict fraudulent transactions promptly.

### Flexible Development Environment:
- Use Python, SQL, or Spark interchangeably during the development of ML features, providing flexibility and ease of use.

## Usage:
Detailed instructions on how to use the fraud detection service are provided in the documentation. Please refer to the documentation for guidance on setting up and utilizing the service effectively.
